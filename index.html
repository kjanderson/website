  Welcome! You have reached my personal web page. Here you will find some samples
  of my work in software and quality.
  </p>
  
  <p>I have over ten years progressive experience in
  software development and software quality.
  My personal mantra is "there's nothing as practical as a good theory",
  and I've been able to put that to good use in some remarkable ways,
  ranging from application of Gage R&amp;R to improve system behavior,
  to recognizing when code generation tools
  produce defects, and how to adapt the software development process to improve
  software quality.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  I hold a BS degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering,
  an MS degree in automatic feedback control, and a PhD degrees in Power Electronics.
  I hold Six-Sigma Green Belt and Six-Sigma Black Belt certifications.
  I currently live and work in the San Gabriel Valley in L.A. County.
  My interests include the technical and social aspects of software creation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  My interests include technical excellence in software creation,
  navigating social interaction from a systems perspective to add value to the organization,
  and process improvement.
