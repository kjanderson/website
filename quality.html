  Gage R&amp;R in Design Engineering
  </h3>
  
  <p>In-house dynamometer exhibited excessive variation (>70% GRR).
  Motor efficiency measurement and tuning was time consuming,
  error-prone, and inaccurate. Each time data from this
  measurement device was shared with customers,
  company credibility was diminished.
  </p>
  
  <p>Measurement:<br />
  There were two potential sources of error in this system.
  One is from the power supply, and the other is from the torque sensor.
  Since the torque sensor is an off-the-shelf part, the first focus area
  was the in-house power supply and its measurement setup.
  Two alternatives were considered in the study:
  1) the in-house power measurement (baseline),
  and 2) an off-the-shelf instrumentation-grade current transducer.

  <p>Analysis:<br />
  An ANOVA-based Gage R&amp;R analysis was conducted on the setup
  for each of the two methods.
  The Part-to-Part variation should represent most of the variation
  in the study (10% GRR is ideal, 30% GRR is acceptable).
  The graphs below clearly show the improvement from 70% to 15%.

  <p>Summary:<br />
  The improvement in the measurement system clearly originated
  from the in-house power supply measurement device.
  This is a simple yet clear example of the importance of
  measurement system analysis in engineering design work.
  Although the measurement system was not capable,
  staff had relied on it for many years prior to this study.
