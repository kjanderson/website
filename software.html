  Defect Prevention in Software Development
  </h3>
  
  <p>How can code-generation tools insert defects?
  </p>
  
  <p>In some cases, it is possible to get C compilers to generate object code
  that is incorrect, even when optimization is turned off.
  This is almost always when volatile global variables are introduced.</p>
  
  <p>Fortunately, this problem can be easily overcome as described in
  <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/emsoft08-preprint.pdf">this paper</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>With a little creativity, this approach can be adapted to maintenance tasks.
  When I have applied this in startup environments,
  the result is liberating, to say the least.
  I have witnessed the culture of organizations transform
  their view of software from that of a black art
  to something that can be planned for.
  As a result, the maturity and capability of the
  software side of the organization improve,
  which leads to large strides in software quality.
